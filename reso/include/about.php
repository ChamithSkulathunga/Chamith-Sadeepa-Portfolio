                I am a fourth-year undergraduate student. With a strong
                understanding of various programming languages, my main career
                goal is to become a Web developer. Passionate about
                self-directed learning, I constantly explore and acquire new
                skills to enhance my expertise. I firmly believe that staying
                up-to-date with the latest industry trends is crucial for
                creating innovative web experiences
